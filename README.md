# Number-Guessing-Game
This is a number-guessing game that I made because it was on my weekly roadmap. This weekly roadmap is something I made so I can get into MIT. In this game, you must guess a number, and it will tell you whether the number you guessed was either too high or too low. You have a total of 5 guesses. You can modify the number of guesses you have at will.
